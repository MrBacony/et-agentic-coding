## Implementation Guidelines

### For All Features

1. **Agentic Coding Approach**
   - Use GitHub Copilot for code generation
   - Leverage instruction files for Angular and conference domain context
   - Use prompt files for specific conference management components
   - Incorporate MCP tools where appropriate

2. **Code Quality**
   - Follow Angular best practices for conference management app
   - Use proper typing with conference-specific interfaces
   - Implement error handling for user actions
   - Create reusable components for conference elements

3. **Documentation**
   - Document your process with AI for conference feature development
   - Note which prompts worked well for conference-specific components
   - Identify challenges and solutions in implementing conference features
   - Prepare brief presentation of your conference feature

4. **Time Management**
   - Focus on core conference functionality first
   - Add polish to user experience if time permits
   - Use provided starting points for conference components
   - Collaborate effectively within your group on feature integration

### Experience Collection

During implementation, document:

1. How did you use agentic coding tools to implement your conference management feature?
2. Which AI techniques were most effective for generating conference-specific components and logic?
3. What challenges did you encounter when using AI for complex conference management tasks?
4. What surprised you about the AI's understanding of conference domain concepts?
5. How would you improve your agentic coding workflow for future conference app development?

This documentation will be valuable for the group sharing session at the end of the workshop and will help all participants learn from each team's unique experiences with their conference feature implementation.
