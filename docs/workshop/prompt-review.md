# Review: Feature-Big Prompt Flow

## Overview
The feature-big prompt flow consists of five main prompts, each guiding the agent through a structured, best-practice-driven process for designing, implementing, testing, and reviewing a new Angular feature in an Nx monorepo. The prompts are:

1. **Design**: Technical design document
2. **Technical Doc**: File structure and code scaffolding
3. **Vitest**: Unit test generation
4. **TDD**: Test-driven implementation
5. **Review**: Automated code review and MCP documentation

## Strengths
- **Clarity & Structure**: Each prompt is focused, with clear requirements and output formats. This ensures a repeatable, high-quality engineering process.
- **Modern Stack Alignment**: Prompts reference current best practices (Angular 20, AnalogJS, Nx 21, Tailwind, NgRx Signal Store, Vitest), ensuring generated code is up-to-date.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The flow separates design, scaffolding, testing, implementation, and review, mirroring real-world agile/enterprise workflows.
- **Automation-Ready**: Output formats (e.g., JSON for MCP, file trees, code comments) are machine- and human-readable, supporting further automation.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Instructions are explicit, with examples and edge-case considerations, reducing ambiguity for LLMs and agents.

## Suggestions for Improvement
- **Consistency in Output**: Consider standardizing output sections (e.g., always include a summary, next steps, and references to previous/next prompts).
- **Edge-Case Handling**: While edge-cases are mentioned, encourage explicit listing of failure modes and recovery strategies in design and test prompts.
- **Validation Steps**: Add a validation checklist or acceptance criteria to each prompt, ensuring outputs meet quality standards before moving to the next step.
- **Feedback Loops**: Suggest a feedback mechanism between review and earlier steps (e.g., if review fails, auto-generate a new design/test prompt).
- **Internationalization**: Some prompts are in German; consider providing English versions or a language toggle for broader adoption.

## Prompt-by-Prompt Notes
- **Design**: Excellent focus on both business and technical requirements. Suggest adding a section for user stories or acceptance criteria.
- **Technical Doc**: Good emphasis on file structure and code comments. Recommend including a rationale for architectural decisions.
- **Vitest**: Clear on test structure and isolation. Could add guidance for code coverage targets and mutation testing.
- **TDD**: Well-structured for incremental delivery. Suggest referencing the related test prompt for traceability.
- **Review**: Comprehensive, including MCP output. Could benefit from a checklist for common Angular/Tailwind pitfalls.

## Conclusion
The feature-big prompt flow is robust, modern, and well-suited for enterprise Angular/Nx development. With minor enhancements for consistency, validation, and feedback, it can serve as a gold standard for agentic coding workflows.
